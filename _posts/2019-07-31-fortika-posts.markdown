Past two months were quite interesting since FORTIKA EU project was under second review by the EU commissions.

Just a quick introduction to [FORTIKA](https://fortika-project.eu) project: this is a EU (H2020) project I am leading activities as a project manager in [XLAB](https://xlab.si).
For the project we are primarily building a marketplace web app which communicates via LWM2M protocol to several instances of HW consisting of ARM and FPGA architectures. The HW instances are capable of deploying services from the Marketplace.

Anyhow, the review was successful and we are moving on with the development. [Here](https://www.xlab.si/blog/fortika-2nd-review-meeting-in-brussels-belgium/?lang=en) is a blog post I've made about the review from the Brussels.
Soon we will be releasing a whitepaper in the FORTIKA that will describe the Marketplace into more details.

[Here](https://www.xlab.si/blog/fortika-technical-meeting-in-murcia-spain/?lang=en) is a blog post related to the technical meeting on the project held in Murcia.

Cheers!
