Past two months were quite interesting since FORTIKA EU project was under second review by the EU commissions.

Just a quick introduction to [FORTIKA][fortikasite] project: this is a EU (H2020( project I am leading activities as a project manager in [XLAB][xlabsite].
For the project we are primarily building a marketplace web app which communicates via ```LWM2M``` protocol to several instances
of HW consisting of ```ARM``` and ```FPGA``` architectures. The HW instances are capable of deploying services from the Marketplace.

Anyhow, the review was successful and we are moving on with the development. [Here][xlabsite2] is a blog post I've made about the review from the Brussels.
Soon we will be releasing a whitepaper in the FORTIKA that will describe the Marketplace into more details.

[Here][xlabsite2] is a blog post related to the technical meeting on the project held in Murcia.

Cheers!
