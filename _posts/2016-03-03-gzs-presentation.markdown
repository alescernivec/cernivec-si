Today I attended business breakfast at [GZS][gzs], where I presented [WITDOM][witdom] and [SPECS][specs] projects. I talked about architecture of E2EE (End-2-end Encryption) database, developed by [Miha Stopar](https://github.com/miha-stopar) in the [SPECS][specs] project.

[WITDOM][witdom] will adopt the solution in order to provide end-to-end encryption solution capable of sharing data between subjects using the service. More is soon yet to come.
