I have been quiet for a while now. Many things happened in the last couple of years of my silence (e.g., corona, moved to a new place, got a kid). Moreover, much stuff happened @ XLAB at work (e.g., being able to work on open source projects and actually being payed for this - which is great!). 

I hope to write some more about the latest in the next posts, see you soon!

Oh, I've also jumped to the Mastodon instance. You can find me on https://toot.si instance: @alescernivec@toot.si. First impressions are great, much less noise there :)

Cheers!
