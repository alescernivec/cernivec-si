I've just migrated from my old static page to this new, sleek, [Jekyll][jekyll] based ... static ... page. 

Anyhow, I've connected this page to [Piwik][piwik] for analytics and everything runs on my Raspbery2-based machine and I hope this to be cheaper than renting EC2 instance running everything.
